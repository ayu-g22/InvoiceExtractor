Sure! Here's the summary in the first person:

"InvoiceExtractor" is a project I developed to extract and process data from invoice PDFs. I used Python along with libraries like OpenCV and Tesseract for image processing and optical character recognition (OCR). The tool efficiently extracts relevant information, such as invoice numbers, dates, and amounts, which can be exported for further analysis or record-keeping.
